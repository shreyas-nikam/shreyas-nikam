# Hi there, I'm Shreyas Nikam 👋

**Full-Stack Software Engineer | Architecting Scalable AI Solutions**

I earned senior responsibility by owning hard problems.

I am a **Tech Lead at QuantUniversity** based in **Boston, MA**, with 4+ years of experience building production-grade AI systems, LLM-powered tools, and scalable cloud infrastructure. I specialize in reducing inference costs and architecting end-to-end AI platforms.

### 🚀 What I Do

* **AI & LLM Systems:** Architecting RAG pipelines, AI agents, and tool routing using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Hugging Face.
* **Engineering Leadership:** Mentoring engineers, designing system architecture, and leading CI/CD strategies for zero-downtime deployments.
* **Cloud & DevOps:** Managing production MLOps and infrastructure using AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Airflow.
* **Full-Stack Development:** Building high-performance applications with FastAPI, Streamlit, Node.js, and Redis.
